# amm_contract

This project implements an Automated Market Maker (AMM) on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. The AMM facilitates token swaps and liquidity provision using the constant product formula (x * y = k). Liquidity providers can add and remove liquidity, and users can swap tokens based on the pool's reserves, with a fee distributed to liquidity providers.
